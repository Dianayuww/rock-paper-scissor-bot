# rock-paper-scissor-bot
A Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) bot developed in Python that intelligently predicts and counters different types of opponent strategies.
The bot is capable of detecting common RPS opponents such as Quincy (fixed pattern), Mrugesh (counter player’s most frequent move), Abbey (responds based on past two moves), and Kris (reacts to player’s last move).
It learns patterns over time and adapts its responses to maximize win rate.
